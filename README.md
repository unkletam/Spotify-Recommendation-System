# Spotify Recommendation System
![banner](assets/banner.png)
This project is a demonstration of a content-based recommendation system for Spotify that leverages user's preferences and audio features to generate personalized song recommendations.

## Introduction
A music recommendation system is a system that uses various techniques to suggest songs or pieces of music to users. The goal of such a system is to personalize the music listening experience for each user, by providing them with a list of songs that they are likely to enjoy based on their listening history, preferences, and other factors. Music recommendation systems have become increasingly popular in recent years, with the rise of streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora. These services use recommendation systems to help users discover new music and to keep them engaged with the platform.

## Problem Definition
There are several challenges in developing a music recommendation system. One of the main challenges is dealing with the large amount of data available. At the same time, there are certain challenges which we want to address with this project. To work on these problems, we will start out by collecting data from Spotify API or a Kaggle dataset. Then we will clean and analyze the data to find insights to better understand the relationship between every variable. Later we will munge the data and apply normalization, encoding preprocessing. Once data is prepared, we aim to try a bunch of models and techniques like collaborative filtering, content filtering, pairwise ranking etc. to find the best model which can recommend songs based on historical data. After defining threshold and retrieving results, we plan to create visualizations which support our output and help convey good recommendations to user.

## Data Sources
Our main goal is to integrate this project with Spotify API. However, in the initial stages we will be using a dataset publicly available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vatsalmavani/spotify-dataset).
